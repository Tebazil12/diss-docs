To do:
- [ ] Compass calibration (?)
- [ ] Arduino-pi comms
- [ ] Sonar driver (?)
- [ ] Or create simple vector feild that prints all vectors in given area under set of criterea
- [ ] PID tuning
- [ ] Motor Calibration ?
- [ ] Servo calibration ?
- [ ] Find vector field simulator (so dont have to write own) ?

Done:
- [x] Compass driver
- [x] Motor driver
- [x] Servo driver
- [x] Investigate how to split area up (gps -> distance desired -> gps)
- [x] decide on final strategic plan for navigating area
- [x] set up pi
- [x] GPS driver
- [x] deside on comms protocal between arduino and pi
- [x] Find exact equations for vector field implementation
