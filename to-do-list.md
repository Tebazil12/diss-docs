To do:
- [ ] Compass calibration (?)
- [ ] Motor Calibration
- [ ] Servo calibration 
- [ ] Arduino-pi comms
- [ ] PID tuning
- [ ] GPS driver
- [ ] Sonar driver (?)
- [ ] Investigate how to split area up (gps -> distance desired -> gps)
- [ ] Find exact equations for vector field implementation
- [ ] Find vector field simulator (so dont have to write own)
- [ ] Or create simple vector feild that prints all vectors in given area under set of criterea
- [ ] decide on final strategic plan for navigating area
- [ ] deside on comms protocal between arduino and pi

Done:
- [x] Compass driver
- [x] Motor driver
- [x] Servo driver
