\section{Background \& Objectives}

\subsection{Background}
previously was used manually using RC. Create a working controll 
system to autonoumously control the boat. 
\cite{nasa}

\subsection{Analysis}
To autonomize the robotic boat - I learnt this... . 

The use of a general control sytem non-specific to sonar would be useful.
A system that can be easily used across simiar platforms. 







\subsection{Process}
This project used Feature Driven Development (FDD) methodology for orginization.
Upfront a desgin for the hardware and a software flow diagram was created, as can be
seen in ***figures ??. A list of tasks to be completed was then kept, with an order 
of priority (the first tasks on the list needed to be completed before the next tasks).
This list was backed up on github, as with the rest of the project, to prevent loss 
of data if one machine was broken or corrupt.
